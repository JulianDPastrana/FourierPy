# FourierPy: Interactive Fourier Series Analysis

FourierPy is an interactive and academic Python application designed for signal analysis courses, focusing on Fourier series analysis.

## Features

- **Fourier Coefficients Calculation**: Compute coefficients for any user-defined signal.
- **Signal Reconstruction**: Reconstruct signals based on their Fourier series coefficients.
- **Visualization**: Plot original vs. reconstructed signals and visualize Fourier coefficients.
- **Support for Multiple Waveforms**: Includes square, triangle, and sawtooth waveforms.
- **Legendre Polynomials**: Uses Legendre polynomials as basis functions for analysis.
